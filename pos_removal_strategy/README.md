RGB POS Removal Strategy
========================

This module extends the pickings created from POS orders to correctly process
products with serial numbers and specific removal strategies.

If the shipment cannot be processed, due to lack of stock or other errors, the
picking will remain in *Waiting Availability / Partially Available* and should
be manually transferred from the backend.
